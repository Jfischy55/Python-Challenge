This is the read.me file for the module 3 challenge

I found a youtube video that explains the process of solving the challenge, I'll list it below.

The main problem I was having was getting my code to properly run in the Git Bash terminal, I had the output messed up which the video helped me figure out.
I'm still having issues getting the code to run properly, it seems like it isn't pulling from the correct files for some reason, planning on asking for help in office hours during Thursday's class.
